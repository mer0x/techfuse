## Introduction

Setting up a homelab can be an exciting venture for tech enthusiasts. However, securing it is crucial to protect against unauthorized access and potential attacks. This blog post will guide you through using **fail2ban**, a popular open-source intrusion prevention software, to secure your homelab. We'll use Docker, Ansible, and bash scripts to provide real-world tested examples for implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following:

- A running homelab environment (could be a physical server or a VM)
- Basic understanding of Docker and Ansible
- Access to a terminal with `sudo` privileges
- Internet connection for downloading necessary packages

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Installing fail2ban

First, let's install fail2ban on your server. You can do this using a simple bash script. Here’s how you can set it up:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and install fail2ban
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y fail2ban

# Enable and start the fail2ban service
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

### Docker Setup

If you prefer using Docker, fail2ban can be set up inside a container. Here's a Dockerfile to get started:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:latest

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y fail2ban && \
    apt-get clean

COPY jail.local /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

ENTRYPOINT ["fail2ban-server", "-f"]
```

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t fail2ban .
docker run -d --name fail2ban --restart=always fail2ban
```

### Ansible Playbook

For those managing multiple servers, Ansible can automate the fail2ban installation process. Below is a sample playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install fail2ban
      apt:
        name: fail2ban
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Ensure fail2ban is running
      service:
        name: fail2ban
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

Run the playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini fail2ban_setup.yml
```

## Configuration and Customization

After installation, customize fail2ban to suit your needs. Edit the `jail.local` file to configure your jails. Here’s an example for SSH protection:

```ini
[sshd]
enabled  = true
port     = ssh
filter   = sshd
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
bantime  = 600
```

Restart the fail2ban service to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

## Security Considerations

- **Regular Updates**: Ensure fail2ban and your system packages are up-to-date.
- **Backup Configuration**: Regularly backup your configuration files to prevent data loss.
- **Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on fail2ban logs (`/var/log/fail2ban.log`) for any unusual activity.

## Troubleshooting

If fail2ban is not working as expected, consider the following checks:

- **Service Status**: Ensure that the fail2ban service is running.
- **Log File Paths**: Verify that the log file paths in your `jail.local` are correct.
- **Firewall Rules**: Check that your firewall is not conflicting with fail2ban rules.

## Conclusion

Securing your homelab with fail2ban is a straightforward process that significantly enhances your setup's security. By integrating Docker, Ansible, and bash scripts, you can implement a robust intrusion prevention system tailored to your requirements. Remember to routinely update and monitor your setup for optimal security.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you'll safeguard your homelab against unauthorized access, allowing you to focus on the more enjoyable aspects of building and experimenting with your personal server environment.
