# Ultimate Guide to Self-Hosting a VPN Using WireGuard or OpenVPN

## Introduction

In an era where online privacy is becoming increasingly crucial, owning a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can provide unparalleled control over your data. Self-hosted VPN solutions, such as WireGuard and OpenVPN, offer a secure way to protect your online activities. Unlike commercial VPN services that operate as middlemen, self-hosting ensures you know who controls your dataâ€”because you do. This guide details how you can deploy a self-hosted VPN using WireGuard or OpenVPN with real-world tested examples using Docker and Ansible, ensuring a swift, secure setup.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation process, you must gather some essential tools and information:

- A server or virtual machine with a public IP address. You can use providers like DigitalOcean, Linode, or your own Proxmox setup.
- Basic understanding of Linux command-line operations.
- An up-to-date system running a Linux distribution like Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Ansible installed on your local machine.
- A Cloudflare account for managing DNS (optional but recommended for easy domain management).

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Server

#### 1.1 Choose Your Hosting Platform

Select a cloud provider or server that suits your needs. If utilizing Proxmox, ensure your VM is allocated with at least 1GB RAM and enough storage to handle traffic.

#### 1.2 Ensure Up-to-Date System

Log into your server and run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Installing Docker

Execute the following commands to install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common -y

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
```

Verify the Docker installation:

```bash
docker --version
```

### Step 3: Setting Up WireGuard with Docker

#### 3.1 Create a WireGuard Docker Configuration

Create a new directory for your WireGuard configuration:

```bash
mkdir ~/wireguard && cd ~/wireguard
```

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  wireguard:
    image: linuxserver/wireguard
    container_name: wireguard
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - SERVERURL=your-server-url
      - SERVERPORT=51820
      - PEERS=1
      - PEERDNS=auto
      - INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /lib/modules:/lib/modules
    ports:
      - 51820:51820/udp
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### 3.2 Deploy WireGuard

Deploy using the Docker Compose command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Setting Up OpenVPN with Docker

#### 4.1 Set Up OpenVPN Configuration

Create another directory for OpenVPN:

```bash
mkdir ~/openvpn && cd ~/openvpn
```

Create the Docker Compose file:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  openvpn:
    image: kylemanna/openvpn
    container_name: openvpn
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "1194:1194/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/openvpn
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### 4.2 Initialize and Start OpenVPN

Generate server configuration:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/config:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://your-server-url
docker run -v $(pwd)/config:/etc/openvpn --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_initpki
```

Start OpenVPN server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: DNS Management with Cloudflare (Optional)

To bind your VPN service to a domain, manage your domain DNS via Cloudflare:

1. Log into your Cloudflare account.
2. Add a DNS entry pointing your domain to the server's public IP.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Ports Not Accessible:** Ensure your firewall allows traffic on WireGuard (51820/udp) or OpenVPN (1194/udp) ports.
   
2. **Docker Issues:** Restart Docker service with `sudo systemctl restart docker` if containers fail to start.

3. **Configuration Errors:** Always check the logs with `docker logs wireguard` or `docker logs openvpn` for specific errors.

## Conclusion

Self-hosting a VPN using WireGuard or OpenVPN equips you with enhanced privacy and control over your data. By leveraging Docker, you can quickly deploy and manage your VPN service efficiently. Follow all security best practices, keep your software updated, and enjoy a secure browsing experience. Whether utilizing WireGuard for its simplicity or OpenVPN for its extensive configuration options, your self-hosted VPN will bolster your online privacy.

This tutorial covers the robust setup of self-hosted VPN solutions, leveraging powerful tools such as Docker and Cloudflare. Owning your VPN never was so accessible and powerful; embark on this journey and safeguard your digital footprints now.
