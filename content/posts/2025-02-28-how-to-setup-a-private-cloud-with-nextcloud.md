# How to Setup a Private Cloud with Nextcloud

In today's digital world, data privacy is more important than ever. While public cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox offer convenience, they also raise concerns about data security and privacy. Setting up your own private cloud with Nextcloud allows you to take control of your data. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a private cloud using Nextcloud, focusing on a self-hosted solution using Docker and Ansible.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- A server with at least 2GB RAM and a modern CPU. This can be a VPS or a physical server.
- A domain name pointing to your server's IP address.
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server.
- Ansible installed on your local machine.
- A secured SSH connection to your server.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Docker Environment

First, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your server. If not, you can install them with the following commands:

```bash
# Update existing list of packages
sudo apt update

# Install prerequisite packages
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

# Add Docker's official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add Docker repository to APT sources
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

# Update package database with Docker packages
sudo apt update

# Install Docker
sudo apt install docker-ce

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Step 2: Deploy Nextcloud with Docker Compose

Create a Docker Compose file for Nextcloud. This file will define the services and configurations needed for your Nextcloud instance.

Create a directory for your Nextcloud setup:

```bash
mkdir ~/nextcloud
cd ~/nextcloud
```

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mariadb
    container_name: nextcloud_db
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example_root_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: nextcloud
      MYSQL_USER: nextcloud
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: example_password

  app:
    image: nextcloud
    container_name: nextcloud_app
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    links:
      - db
    volumes:
      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: example_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: nextcloud
      MYSQL_USER: nextcloud
      MYSQL_HOST: db

volumes:
  db:
  nextcloud:
```

Launch the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Configure Nextcloud

Visit `http://yourdomain.com:8080` in your browser. You should see the Nextcloud setup page. Enter your admin username and password, and complete the setup process using the database details from your `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Step 4: Secure Your Nextcloud Instance

For security, it's crucial to secure your Nextcloud instance with HTTPS. We'll use Let's Encrypt to obtain a free SSL certificate.

Install Certbot on your server:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot
```

Stop the Nextcloud container to free up port 80:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Obtain an SSL certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
```

After obtaining the certificate, modify your `docker-compose.yml` to use HTTPS. Add a reverse proxy using Nginx:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  proxy:
    image: nginx
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

  # Previous db and app services here...

volumes:
  db:
  nextcloud:
```

Create an `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nextcloud_app:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Restart the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Automate Deployment with Ansible

Create an Ansible playbook to automate the deployment:

```yaml
---
- hosts: your_server
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Docker is installed
      apt:
        name: docker-ce
        state: present
        update_cache: true

    - name: Ensure Docker Compose is installed
      get_url:
        url: "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m`"
        dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Copy Docker Compose file
      copy:
        src: ./docker-compose.yml
        dest: /home/your_user/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml

    - name: Start Nextcloud services
      command: docker-compose up -d
      args:
        chdir: /home/your_user/nextcloud
```

Run your playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

## Security

### Regular Updates

Keep your Nextcloud instance and all related services updated. This includes Docker images, the Nextcloud application, and your server's operating system.

### Backup Strategy

Implement a robust backup strategy. Regularly backup your Nextcloud data and database. You can use tools like `rsync` and `mysqldump` for this purpose.

### Harden Configuration

Review and harden your Nextcloud configuration. Disable unnecessary apps and use strong passwords and encryption.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Database Connection Error**: Ensure your database credentials in the `docker-compose.yml` file are correct.
- **Permission Issues**: Make sure the volumes are correctly mounted and the Nextcloud user has the right permissions.
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Verify your domain is pointing to your server and that ports 80 and 443 are open.

### Logs

Check Docker logs for troubleshooting:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've set up a secure, private cloud using Nextcloud. This setup gives you full control over your data while providing the flexibility and accessibility of cloud services. Remember to maintain your server and keep your Nextcloud instance updated to ensure optimal performance and security.

With your private cloud up and running, you can now explore the vast ecosystem of apps and integrations that Nextcloud offers to enhance your productivity and collaboration.
