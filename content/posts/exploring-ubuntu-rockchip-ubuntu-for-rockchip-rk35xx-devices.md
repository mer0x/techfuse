title: 'Exploring ubuntu-rockchip: Ubuntu for Rockchip RK35XX Devices'
---

## Introduction

Single-board computers (SBCs) that utilize Rockchip RK35XX series processors, such as the popular RK3566 and RK3588, have gained significant momentum due to their powerful yet energy-efficient performance. These boards are ideal for embedded systems, IoT projects, media servers, lightweight servers, robotics, and edge computing tasks. However, official support for mainstream Linux distributions, particularly Ubuntu, has often been limited or challenging to set up.

The **ubuntu-rockchip** project aims to bridge this gap, providing a streamlined, optimized Ubuntu experience specifically tailored for Rockchip RK35XX-based SBCs. In this guide, we'll explore how to get started using ubuntu-rockchip on your RK35XX device, walking you through installation, initial setup, and essential configurations.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- An RK35XX-based SBC (e.g., RK3566 or RK3588)
- MicroSD card or eMMC storage (16GB minimum recommended)
- A microSD card reader
- Host PC with Ubuntu/Linux or Windows/macOS for preparing the installation media
- HDMI monitor, keyboard, and mouse (optional but recommended for initial setup)

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download ubuntu-rockchip Image

First, download the latest ubuntu-rockchip image tailored for your specific RK35XX device from the [official ubuntu-rockchip GitHub repository](https://github.com/Joshua-Riek/ubuntu-rockchip/releases). Choose the appropriate version for your hardware (RK3566 or RK3588).

### Step 2: Flashing the Image to MicroSD/eMMC

Once downloaded, flash the image onto your microSD card or eMMC module. The recommended tool for this task is **balenaEtcher**, but you can also use standard Linux command-line utilities such as `dd`.

#### Using balenaEtcher (Cross-platform):

1. Launch balenaEtcher.
2. Select the downloaded ubuntu-rockchip image file (`.img` or `.img.xz`).
3. Choose your microSD card or eMMC storage as the destination medium.
4. Click "Flash!" to start writing the image.

#### Using `dd` (Linux):

Open a terminal and execute:

```bash
sudo dd if=ubuntu-rockchip.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```

Replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual device identifier. **Caution:** Double-check your device path to avoid accidentally overwriting critical data.

### Step 3: Booting the RK35XX Device

Insert the microSD or eMMC module into your RK35XX board, connect peripherals (keyboard, mouse, HDMI monitor), and power the device on.

Upon booting for the first time, the system will resize its filesystem automatically. This initial boot may take a few minutes.

### Step 4: Logging In and Initial Configuration

After booting, you'll be presented with a login prompt. The default credentials for ubuntu-rockchip images are typically:

```
Username: ubuntu
Password: ubuntu
```

Once logged in, it's highly recommended to immediately change the default password for security:

```bash
passwd
```

### Step 5: Updating the System

To ensure your system is up-to-date, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 6: Installing Essential Packages

Depending on your project or application, you may want to install additional packages. Here are some commonly-used packages to consider:

- **Development tools:**

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake pkg-config
```

- **Networking tools:**

```bash
sudo apt install net-tools network-manager
```

- **Docker (optional, for containerized workloads):**

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

## Advanced Configuration and Tips

### Installing GPU and Multimedia Drivers

One of the key advantages of RK35XX devices is their GPU acceleration and multimedia capabilities. To leverage hardware acceleration, you'll want to install Rockchip-specific drivers and libraries.

#### Example: Installing the Mali GPU Driver (RK3566/RK3588):

Check your GPU model and install the appropriate Mali GPU drivers:

```bash
sudo apt install mali-g610-firmware
```

**Note:** GPU driver packages may vary based on your specific RK35XX model and image build.

### Overclocking and Performance Tweaks (Advanced Users)

ubuntu-rockchip images typically come with conservative performance settings. For advanced users, CPU/GPU frequency scaling and other performance settings can be adjusted via sysfs or configuration files located in `/sys/devices/system/cpu/`.

Be cautious when adjusting these settings, as incorrect values can cause system instability or overheating.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Device does not boot:** Ensure you have downloaded the correct image for your hardware. Verify the flashing process completed successfully.
- **No HDMI output:** Check cable connections and confirm that your monitor supports the default resolution. If necessary, use SSH to remotely connect and configure HDMI settings via `/boot/config.txt` or equivalent device-specific configuration.
- **Ethernet or Wi-Fi issues:** Verify network interfaces with `ip addr` and ensure firmware drivers are installed (`sudo apt install linux-firmware`).

## Conclusion

The ubuntu-rockchip project significantly simplifies running Ubuntu on Rockchip RK35XX devices, providing a user-friendly and familiar Linux environment optimized for these powerful yet affordable SBCs. By following this guide, you've learned how to install ubuntu-rockchip, perform initial configuration, update your system, and install essential packages and drivers.

Whether you're building a media server, edge computing node, IoT gateway, or robotics platform, ubuntu-rockchip offers the flexibility and stability of Ubuntu tailored specifically for your Rockchip hardware.
