## Introduction

Self-hosting Nextcloud offers a personal or organizational solution to manage and share files, calendars, contacts, and more. By taking control of sensitive data, you avoid third-party cloud storage risks, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. Nextcloud offers extensive features and is supported by a vibrant community making it an ideal choice for self-hosting. This tutorial will guide you through securely self-hosting Nextcloud using Docker, leveraging tools like Nginx for web servers, Let's Encrypt for free SSL/TLS certificates, and fail2ban for intrusion prevention.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic knowledge of Linux:** Comfort with command-line operations is necessary.
- **A Linux server:** Ubuntu Server 22.04 or newer recommended.
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** Installed and configured on your system.
- **Domain Name:** Ensure you have a registered domain that can be pointed to your server.
- **Firewall:** Ensure a firewall is set up, allowing ports 80, 443, and SSH.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Setup Your Server Environment

1. **Update and Upgrade Your System:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**

   Follow official instructions to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for Ubuntu:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io -y
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker
   ```

   To install Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-compose -y
   ```

3. **Set up a Non-Root User:**

   Create a dedicated user with sudo privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo adduser nextcloud
   sudo usermod -aG sudo,docker nextcloud
   ```

4. **Configure Firewall:**

   Using UFW to open necessary ports:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

### Step 2: Setup Nextcloud with Docker Compose

1. **Create Docker Compose File:**

   Create a directory for Nextcloud setup and create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/nextcloud && cd ~/nextcloud
   ```

   ```yaml
   version: '3.7'
   services:
     nextcloud:
       image: nextcloud:latest
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - 8080:80
       volumes:
         - nextcloud-data:/var/www/html
       environment:
         - MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
         - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
         - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
         - MYSQL_HOST=db

     db:
       image: mariadb
       restart: unless-stopped
       volumes:
         - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
       environment:
         - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword
         - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
         - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
         - MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword

   volumes:
     nextcloud-data:
     db-data:
   ```

   Ensure to replace `yourpassword` with a strong password.

2. **Start the Docker Containers:**

   Execute the following command to start services:

   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Step 3: Secure Nextcloud with HTTPS

1. **Install Certbot for SSL Certificates:**

   Install Certbot and the Nginx plugin:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
   ```

2. **Get SSL Certificate:**

   Request SSL certificate for your domain:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
   ```

3. **Set up Automatic Certificate Renewal:**

   Test the renewal process:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

### Step 4: Enhance Security with fail2ban

1. **Install fail2ban:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install fail2ban -y
   ```

2. **Configure fail2ban for Nextcloud:**

   Create a custom filter:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   ```

   Add the following configuration:

   ```
   [nextcloud]
   enabled = true
   filter = nextcloud
   port  = http,https
   logpath = /var/www/nextcloud-data/nextcloud.log
   maxretry = 3
   ```

   Ensure fail2ban is running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Nextcloud Setup Not Loading:**

  Ensure that Docker containers are running smoothly. Execute:

  ```bash
  sudo docker ps
  ```

  Check logs for errors:

  ```bash
  sudo docker-compose logs
  ```

- **SSL Certificate Issues:**

  Check Nginx configurations and ensure your domain DNS records point to your server. Re-run Certbot if needed.

- **Permissions Error:**

  Ensure Docker volumes are set correctly and check permissions of `/var/www/html`.

  ```bash
  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
  ```

### Conclusion

Congratulations on setting up a secure, self-hosted Nextcloud instance!
