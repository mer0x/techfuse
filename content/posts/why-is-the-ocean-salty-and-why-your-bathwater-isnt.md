title: Why is the Ocean Salty? (And Why Your Bathwater Isn't!)
---

Have you ever tasted seawater at the beach? Yuck, it's salty! But have you ever wondered why the ocean tastes salty and the water in your bathtub doesn't? Let's explore together!

## Rivers and Rocks: A Salty Story

Imagine the rivers as giant slides. Rain falls onto mountains and hills, and then it slides down rivers all the way to the ocean. On its way, the water touches and rubs against rocks and dirt. Rocks have tiny bits of salt and minerals (little pieces of rock) inside them. When the water rubs against these rocks, it picks up these tiny salty bits and carries them along.

So rivers collect tiny salty minerals from rocks, then deliver them to the ocean. And this has been happening for millions and millions of years!

## Why Does Salt Stay in the Ocean?

Now, here's something even more interesting. Rivers bring the salt to the ocean, but the water from the ocean doesn't stay forever. The sun heats the ocean, and some of the water turns into steam and rises up into the air‚Äîthis is called evaporation. When water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind. It's like when you spill juice on the table, and the water disappears, but a sticky sugar spot stays behind. Salt does the same thing‚Äîit stays in the ocean.

So the ocean keeps getting saltier because the rivers keep bringing more salt, but the salt never leaves!

## Fun Facts About Ocean Salt

- üê≥ **The ocean is REALLY salty:** If you took all the salt from the oceans, you could cover the land on Earth with a layer of salt as tall as a 40-story building!
- ü•® **Not all water is salty:** Lakes and rivers usually aren't salty because they keep sending their salt to the oceans, and the salt doesn't get a chance to build up.
- üåä **Some oceans are saltier than others:** Hotter places can have saltier oceans because more water evaporates, leaving extra salt behind.

## Why Isn't Your Bathwater Salty?

Good question! Your bathtub water isn't salty because it comes from rivers, lakes, or underground water sources that don't have much salt. And remember, rivers, lakes, and streams are always sending their salt to the ocean, so they don't have time to get salty like the ocean does.

## So, Why is the Ocean Salty?

The ocean is salty because rivers have been carrying tiny bits of salt from rocks into it for millions of years. When the sun heats the ocean, water evaporates but salt stays behind. Over a very long time, the salt builds up, making the ocean taste salty!

Now you know! Next time you're at the beach, you can tell your friends why the ocean tastes salty‚Äîand why your bathwater doesn't!
